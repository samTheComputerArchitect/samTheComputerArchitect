# About Me

Hey, I'm Samarth Javagal, a 13-year-old with a strong passion for computer architecture and programming. I have extensive experience in Python, a bit in C++ and Golang, and I'm currently diving deep into designing custom computers.

### My Achievements:
- *built two SAP-1-like computers using Arduinos as memory, learning a ton about digital logic, microcontrollers, and hardware-software interaction.
- Currently working on an SAP-2 build (with detailed videos on YouTube). I’m documenting the entire process from scratch, module by module, and I'm excited to share my journey with others.
- Made my own architecture called SDP, i have a repo on it.
- Developed a package on PyPI called 'sap2assembler'
- Developed a new algorithm called RBOT for object tracking on CPUs that i tested, and even got 40-50 FPS.
- Developed a new algorithm called VSI for wakeword detection, but can also be used for detecting certain sounds.

### sap2assembler
  I have made an assembler for the SAP2 architecture, and published it on PyPI under the name 'sap2assembler'. It supports:
    * All the sap2 instructions defined in the ISA
    * Labels
    * Variable definition
    * Expression parsing
    * .org, .byte, .word, and ascii directives
    * custom Macros
    * Customization, like changing, removing, or adding an instruction

### RBOT
  My RBOT algorithm stands for ROI Based Object Tracking. and uses images just labelled as object or not object, instead of the object's coordinates. It's on PyPI under the name 'rbobjecttracking'.

### VSI
  My VSI algorithm stands for Value Based Sound Inference. and it uses raw microphone values, stores them as arrays, and uses those arrays for training data and trains a model. 
  It's also on PyPI under the name 'vbsoundinference'

I'm always exploring new ways to push my understanding of hardware and software — from building my own CPUs to experimenting with unique architecture designs.

Feel free to follow my journey!!!
