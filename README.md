# About Me

Hey, I'm Samarth Javagal, a 13-year-old with a strong passion for computer architecture and programming. I have extensive experience in Python, a bit in C++ and Golang, and I'm currently diving deep into designing custom computers.

### My Achievements:
- *bilt two SAP-1-like computers using Arduinos as memory, learning a ton about digital logic, microcontrollers, and hardware-software interaction.
- Currently working on an SAP-2 build (with detailed videos on YouTube). I’m documenting the entire process from scratch, module by module, and I'm excited to share my journey with others.

I'm always exploring new ways to push my understanding of hardware and software — from building my own CPUs to experimenting with unique architecture designs.

Feel free to follow my journey, and let’s connect if you're into computer architecture or just want to chat about projects!
